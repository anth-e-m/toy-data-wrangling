This project is based on a toy data set showing product purchases from an electronics store. There are four brands: Philips, Akzo, Van Houten, and Unilever. However, there are many different spellings and capitalizations of those names. Also, the product code and number are combined in one column, separated by a hypen. R is used to clean this data set to make it easier to visualize and analyze.
